4 main combat styles :
[[Fire Combat Style]] > Direct damage, straightforward and fast techniques. Trying to cut down the enemy before he gets to strike back

[[Water Combat Style]] > Fast Movement and repositioning. Using dodges, dashes and taijutsu  to overwhelm the enemy.

[[Wind Combat Style]]> Broad Long reaching attacks that are hard to dodge. Distance management and out reaching the enemy.

[[Stone Combat Style]] > Blocking and parrying to then deliver counter blows.  Waits to catch the enemy in blocks so that it can deliver strong counterattacks.

Each Character can have up to two elemental combat styles, which allows them to have [[Special Ability]] of that style. Mixing styles will result in advanced [[Stances]].
